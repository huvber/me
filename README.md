# Andrea Mannara' Website

Hi,

I'm Andrea and this is my website.

Here you can find my attempts to write
<a href="/articles">Articles</a>, a
<a href="/shared">Bucket list</a>
of articles that I find interesting and a fuzzy and incomplete list of
<a href="/projects">Projects</a>
that I tried, like this website.

I hope you will enjoy!

>PS: I'm huge fan of FFVI, for this reason this website is a tribute to its 
>menu. I hope SquareEnix would appreciate that.

## Cloning
This project is open source because I really believe on sharing knownledge. 
Feel free to clone it and change the content or just use part of it if you 
like. Avoid to use my name or to pretend to be me because that is not very
nice and I don't think would be useful.
