<p>Hi,</p>
<p>I'm Andrea and this is my website.</p>
<p>
  Here you can find my attempts to write
  <a href="/articles">Articles</a>, a
  <a href="/shared">Bucket list</a>
  of articles that I find interesting and a fuzzy and incomplete list of
  <a href="/projects">Projects</a>
  that I tried, like this website.
</p>
<p>I hope you will enjoy!</p>
<br />
<em>
  PS: I'm huge fan of FFVI, for this reason this website is a tribute to its menu. I hope SquareEnix
  would appreciate that.
